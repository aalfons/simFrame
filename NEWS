Changes in simFrame version 0.5.4

    + Fixed DOI's and URL's in documentation.

    + Properly registered C++ functions.

    + Properly imported all required functions from package 'stats'.

    + Bugfix in clusterSetup() involving typo in object name.

    + Removed demo()'s.

    + Removed links to package 'sampling' from documentation.

    + Removed package 'mvtnorm' from examples.

    + Removed package vignettes due to the CRAN requirement that packages in

      can still be found on https://github.com/aalfons/simFrame


Changes in simFrame version 0.5.3

    + Number of worker processes in examples for parallel computing is now
      limited to 2.


Changes in simFrame version 0.5.2

    + Bugfix in 'clusterRunSimulation' regarding export of internal object to
      worker processes.

    + Bugfix in demo for model-based simulation with parallel computing.


Changes in simFrame version 0.5.1

    + Slight optimizations in C++ code to compute inclusion probabilities.

    + Modified vignette according to changes in package 'robCompositions'
      (function 'invilr' renamed to 'isomLRinv').

    + Moved vignettes to 'vignettes' folder.


Changes in simFrame version 0.5.0

    + Using package 'parallel' now for parallel computing instead of 'snow'.

    + 'runSimulation' and 'clusterRunSimulation' no longer produce a warning
      when simulations are performed separately on different domains.



Changes in simFrame version 0.4.4

    + Rewrote parts of the C++ code.


Changes in simFrame version 0.4.3

    + S4 generic 'getCall' now has '...' argument to be consistent with
      R 2.14.0 S3 generic.

    + Updated author affiliation.


Changes in simFrame version 0.4.2

    + Midzuno and Tille sampling now give a warning instead of throwing an error
      when all inclusion probabilities are outside the interval (eps, 1-eps).


Changes in simFrame version 0.4.1

    + Added column to example data 'eusilcP' that indicates the main income
      holder of each household.


Changes in simFrame version 0.4

    + Implemented 'runSimulation' and 'clusterRunSimulation' methods for mixed
      simulation designs.

    + Added control class "TwoStageControl" and corresponding 'setup' and
      'clusterSetup' methods for two-stage sampling.

    + Probability weights or inclusion probabilities for unequal probability
      sampling can now be supplied by specifying a variable of the population
      data.

    + Using Rcpp now to incorporate C++ instead of C code.

    + Added functions 'brewer', 'midzuno' and 'tille' for Brewer, Midzuno and
      Tille sampling, respectively (corresponding to 'UPbrewer', 'UPmidzuno'
      and 'UPtille' from package 'sampling', but faster C++ implementation).



Changes in simFrame version 0.3.7

    + Added JSS paper to references in help files and vignettes.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3.6

    + Changes in package vignettes.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3.5

    + Improved code in 'CITATION' file.

    + Updated references in package vignettes.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3.4

    + If 'nrep' is not supplied in 'runSimulation' or 'clusterRunSimulation',
      the corresponding slot of the resulting "SimResults" objects now contains
      a zero-length numeric vector instead of 0.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3.3

    + Changes in help file for package.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3.2

    + Changes in help file for accessor and mutator functions.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3.1

    + Bugfix in 'clusterSetup' solved problem with inclusion probabilities for
      group sampling if the data are not sorted according to the groups.


Changes in simFrame version 0.3

    + Control class "NAControl" now allows to specify an auxiliary variable
      with probability weights for each target variable.

    + To improve computational performance in simulation studies, 'contaminate'
      and 'setNA' no longer check if auxiliary variable(s) with probability
      weights are numeric and contain only finite positive values ('sample'
      still throws an error in these cases).

    + Bugfix in 'setup' solved problem with inclusion probabilities for group
      sampling if the data are not sorted according to the groups.

    + Classes "SampleSetup" and "SimResults" now contain slots for the control
      object(s) used.  Accordingly, some redundant slots were removed from
      class "SampleSetup".

    + Added package 'sampling' to 'Suggests' section of 'DESCRIPTION' file,
      minimal changes in 'simDensityplot', 'simXyplot' and in help file
      'tail-methods' so that 'R CMD check' and 'R CMD INSTALL' no longer
      produce warnings or notes.



Changes in simFrame version 0.2

    + Argument 'average' added to plot function 'simXyplot' that specifies
      whether the mean or median is used to compute averages.

    + Replaced example data, which is now called 'eusilcP' and has household
      income components.

    + Added accessor and mutator functions 'getFoo' and 'setFoo' for slots
      (here "foo" stands for the name of the slot).  If no method 'setFoo' is
      available, this means that the slot is not supposed to be changed by the
      user.

    + Renamed slots "group" to "grouping" and "method" to "fun" (where
      available) since functions named 'getGroup', 'getMethod' and 'setMethod'
      already exist and cannot be used for accessor and mutator functions,
      respectively.

    + Renamed function 'getProb' to 'inclusionProb' to allow accessor method
      for slot "prob".

    + Removed class "SimResult" to avoid confusion.

    + Added 'show' methods and improved existing ones.

    + Added 'summary', 'head' and 'tail' methods.

    + Restructured help.

    + Added demos for design-based simulation, model-based simulation and
      parallel computing.

    + Classes "SampleControl" and "SampleSetup" now contain a slot that
      indicates whether groups are collected after sampling individuals or
      sampled directly.

    + Class "SampleSetup" now contains a slot that stores the seed of the
      random number generator before and after setting up the samples.

    + Made various improvements for plot functions if simulation results with
      multiple contamination levels or missing value rates are supplied.

    + Included package vignettes.



Changes in simFrame version 0.1.2

    + Class "NAControl" now contains a slot that specifies whether missing
      values should also be inserted into contaminated observations.

    + Added 'aggregate' method for objects of class "SimResults".

    + In function 'contaminate', the column ".contaminated" is always appended,
      even if 'epsilon' is 0 or 'x' does not have any rows.


Changes in simFrame version 0.1.1

    + Argument 'select' added to plot functions for specifying columns to be
      plotted.

    + Row names of example data 'eusilc' are now sorted from 1 to the number of
      rows.

    + Fixed cross-references in some help files.
