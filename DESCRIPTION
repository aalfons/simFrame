Version: 0.5.4
Title: Simulation Framework
Date: 2021-10-11
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), Rcpp (>= 0.8.6), lattice, parallel
Imports: methods, stats4
LinkingTo: Rcpp
Description: A general framework for statistical simulation, which allows researchers to make use of a wide range of simulation designs with minimal programming effort.  The package provides functionality for drawing samples from a distribution or a finite population, for adding outliers and missing values, as well as for visualization of the simulation results.  It follows a clear object-oriented design and supports parallel computing to increase computational performance.
